The objective of this project is to bring all of the parts of Fusebox (its local, common, and remote aspects) together in an easy-to-use, intuitive, and managable API.
This API will be divided into three main sections: LOCAL, COMMON, and REMOTE.

> LOCAL: All code that depends or relies on Spiggot
> REMOTE: Code used for connecting with things like BungeeCord or MySQL
> Common: Code usable for both local and remote that does NOT require any jars to function.
